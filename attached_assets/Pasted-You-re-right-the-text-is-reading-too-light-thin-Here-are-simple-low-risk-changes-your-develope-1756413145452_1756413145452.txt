You’re right—the text is reading too light/thin. Here are **simple, low-risk changes** your developer can make to improve readability immediately, without touching app logic.

---

# 1) Stop “thin” font smoothing on macOS/Safari

Your base CSS applies Tailwind’s `antialiased` to the body, which makes text *look thinner* on macOS. Swap to `subpixel-antialiased` for a darker, crisper appearance.

**File:** `client/src/index.css`
**Change:**

```diff
@layer base {
  * {
    @apply border-border;
  }

  body {
-   @apply font-sans antialiased bg-background text-foreground;
+   @apply font-sans subpixel-antialiased bg-background text-foreground;
  }
}
```

> Impact: \~30-second fix; very noticeable weight/contrast boost in Safari.

---

# 2) Darken muted body copy (no component rewrites)

A lot of paragraphs use `text-muted-foreground`. Right now that token is too light. Darken it a bit in light mode, and lighten it in dark mode for better contrast.

**File:** `client/src/index.css`
**Change the tokens** (values shown assume you’ve adopted the recommended HSL-channel tokens; if you still keep full `hsl(...)`, wrap these in `hsl(...)`):

```diff
:root {
-  --muted-foreground: 215.4 16.3% 46.9%;
+  --muted-foreground: 215 16% 35%;  /* darker for readability */
}

.dark {
-  --muted-foreground: 210 3.3898% 46.2745%;
+  --muted-foreground: 210 6% 72%;   /* lighter for readability on dark UI */
}
```

> Impact: All existing `text-muted-foreground` copy becomes more legible without touching component code.

---

# 3) Slightly increase default type sizes, app-wide (one place)

You use `text-sm` and `text-base` everywhere. Bumping those sizes *globally* avoids editing dozens of components.

**File:** `tailwind.config.ts`
**Add to `theme.extend`**:

```ts
extend: {
  fontSize: {
    // subtle, safe bumps for readability
    sm: ['0.95rem', { lineHeight: '1.6' }],      // was 0.875rem
    base: ['1.0625rem', { lineHeight: '1.7' }],  // 17px, was 1rem
  },
}
```

> Impact: Paragraphs and labels stop feeling “squinty,” while headings/buttons remain balanced.

---

# 4) Nudge body text weight a touch (variable-font-safe)

Your page already loads variable Google fonts (e.g., Roboto, Inter). Set a *slightly* heavier default body weight (450) where supported; fall back to 400 elsewhere.

**File:** `client/src/index.css`
**Add just below the `body { ... }` rules:**

```css
@supports (font-variation-settings: normal) {
  body { font-weight: 450; } /* subtle bump for variable fonts */
}
```

> Impact: Improves text presence without the “bold” look of 500. Safe, reversible.

---

# 5) (Optional, one-line) Use a more readable sans by default

You’re already loading **Inter** (high x-height, excellent screen legibility). Point `--font-sans` at Inter instead of Roboto (everything else stays the same).

**File:** `client/src/index.css`
**Change:**

```diff
- --font-sans: "Roboto", system-ui, sans-serif;
+ --font-sans: "Inter", system-ui, -apple-system, "Segoe UI", Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Arial, "Noto Sans", "Liberation Sans", sans-serif;
```

> Impact: Inter renders a hair heavier and clearer on macOS/Windows without feeling bulky.

---

## Quick acceptance checklist

* [ ] Body text looks darker on macOS/Safari (no more “ink-starved” feel).
* [ ] Paragraphs set in `text-muted-foreground` are clearly readable on both themes.
* [ ] Default copy size feels \~1–2px larger across the app; headings/buttons still feel proportional.
* [ ] No component logic changed; only tokens/base types updated.

---

### Notes (if you haven’t done the earlier color-token fix)

If you haven’t yet converted your Tailwind color mapping to `hsl(var(--token))` with **channel** tokens (so `/5`, `/10` tints render correctly), do that as well—it also affects perceived contrast across tinted panels. (Happy to paste the exact snippet again.)

---

**Confidence:**

* **High** that steps **#1–#3** will noticeably reduce squinting and improve legibility with minimal risk.
* **Medium-High** for **#4–#5** (typography taste & variable-font availability can vary by browser/OS, but both are simple to toggle).
